# Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates customer segmentation for a mall using the K-means clustering algorithm. The analysis aims to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Key Contents

### 1. Library Imports
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Seaborn, Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

### 2. Data Exploration
- Loading and initial examination of the dataset
- Basic statistical analysis

### 3. Data Visualization
- Distribution plots for key features
- Correlation analysis

### 4. Clustering
- Application of K-means algorithm
- Determination of optimal number of clusters

### 5. Insights
- Analysis of identified customer segments
- Visualization of clusters

## Main Findings

Five distinct customer groups were identified:
1. High spending score, high annual income
2. Low spending score, low annual income
3. Medium spending score, medium annual income
4. Low spending score, high annual income
5. High spending score, low annual income

## Key Features

- **PCA Implementation**: Used to identify high-variance features
- **Advanced Visualization**: Scatter plots to represent clustering results
- **In-depth Analysis**: Detailed examination of each customer segment
